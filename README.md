# Performance Report
[Performance and visibility report using Microsoft Excel](https://github.com/dennyny/PerformanceFile)

•	Service Centre Energy Performance and visibility

•	Data pulled from a remote monitoring device.

•	Excel functions used to manipulate data and calculate fields.

•	Pivot table for advance calculations.

# Overview

For the report, I created metrics and used formulas to check performance of Factory service centres. 
This can be useful for operational activities for manufacturing, logistics, supply chain and various types of industries. 
I was able to get data from remote monitoring device to calculate how which power source a service centre is running on and how much visibility have they got at every point in time within a week.
