•	Data pulled from a remote monitoring device.

# Overview

For the report, I created metrics and used formulas to check performance of Factory service centres. 
This can be useful for operational activities for manufacturing, logistics, supply chain and various types of industries. 
I was able to get data from remote monitoring device to calculate how which power source a service centre is running on and how much visibility have they got at every point in time within a week.
